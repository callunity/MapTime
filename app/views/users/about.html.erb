     <div class='title'>About Map Time</div>
     <p> Map Time is an interactive data mapping tool that allows you to create visual representation of demographic data as well as download that data in full. 
       <br><br>
       Currently Map Time is soley focused on census tract data for the GTA. We plan to extend this tool for all of Canada. 
       <br><br>
       Census tracts (CTs) are small, relatively stable geographic areas that usually have a population between 2,500 and 8,000 persons. They are located in census metropolitan areas and in census agglomerations that had a core population of 50,000 or more in the previous census.
       <br><br>
       The most current Census data is 2011. 
       <br><br>
       Planned expansions:
       <li> Locational data expanded to all of Canada.</li>
       <li> Allow users to save images of each map they create.</li>
       <li> Allow users a more detailed and specific experience when downloading data</li>
       <li> Include more visual data representations including linear regression analysis and other statistical graphing.</li>
